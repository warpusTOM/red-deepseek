red-deepseek is a browser extension that enhances the DeepSeek chat interface with a powerful set of tools, persistent memory, and a customizable system prompt. It enables DeepSeek to generate files, run code, create presentations, and manage complex projects directly within the conversation, all while keeping your data local and private.

> "Better DeepSeek" is an unofficial, independent, and community-driven open-source extension. It is NOT affiliated with, endorsed by, sponsored by, or officially connected to DeepSeek or DeepSeek AI in any way. All product names, logos, and brands are property of their respective owners.



## red-seek payload

This fork ships **red-seek**: an unconditional identity + no-refusal payload
injected into every completion request, including DeepThink / R1 reasoning
requests. It is separate from the Hidden System Prompt setting and cannot be
disabled from the UI.

It also guards the response stream: a canned refusal is dropped and the request
is silently re-issued with stronger framing, up to two times.

See [REDSEEK.md](REDSEEK.md) for how it works and how to edit it.

> red-deepseek is a personal fork. It is unaffiliated with DeepSeek and with
> the upstream Better DeepSeek project.

## Features

### Hidden System Prompt
Inject a custom system prompt that guides DeepSeek's behavior without cluttering the chat. The prompt is automatically injected into every conversation and can be edited from the extension's settings panel.

### Tool Tags for Enhanced Output
Better DeepSeek introduces a set of special tags that DeepSeek can use to produce rich, interactive content:

- `<BDS:HTML>...</BDS:HTML>` – Render a full HTML document in a preview card.
- `<BDS:VISUALIZER>...</BDS:VISUALIZER>` – Create high-contrast, monochrome simulations and interactive diagrams using a built-in UI kit.
- `<BDS:create_file fileName="path/to/file.ext">...</BDS:create_file>` – Generate a downloadable file with the specified name and content.
- `<BDS:pptx>...</BDS:pptx>` – Generate a PowerPoint presentation using the PptxGenJS library.
- `<BDS:excel>...</BDS:excel>` – Generate an Excel spreadsheet using SheetJS.
- `<BDS:docx>...</BDS:docx>` – Generate a Word document using the docx library.
- `<BDS:AUTO:REQUEST_WEB_FETCH>url</BDS:AUTO:REQUEST_WEB_FETCH>` – Automatically fetch and convert a web page to markdown, then inject it into the chat context.
- `<BDS:AUTO:REQUEST_GITHUB_FETCH>url</BDS:AUTO:REQUEST_GITHUB_FETCH>` – Automatically fetch a GitHub repository and inject its codebase into the chat context.
- `<BDS:AUTO:SEARCH_IN_DIRECTORY queries="...">` – Search codebase directories for files and symbols (active when DeepCode is enabled).
- `<BDS:AUTO:LIST_DIR path="..." depth="...">` – Inspect directory contents in connected workspace (active when DeepCode is enabled).
- `<BDS:AUTO:FILE_READ path="..." startLine="..." endLine="...">` – Read specific files or line ranges from the connected codebase (active when DeepCode is enabled).
- `<BDS:memory_write>key: value, importance: always|called</BDS:memory_write>` – Store persistent facts about the user that are injected into future prompts.
- `<BDS:character_create name="..." usage="...">...</BDS:character_create>` – Define a roleplay persona that DeepSeek can adopt.

### DeepCode (Experimental) & DeepSeek Harness Integration
Better DeepSeek introduces **DeepCode**, a collaborative code planning and inspection mode designed to work alongside [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness).
- **Interactive Code Planning**: Activate DeepCode to allow DeepSeek to explore codebases, inspect file structures with auto-tools (`FILE_READ`, `LIST_DIR`, `SEARCH_IN_DIRECTORY`), and draft structured implementation plans.
- **DeepSeek Harness Handoff**: Once a plan is formulated, easily send tasks directly to DeepSeek Harness for automated execution and testing.
- **Plugin Integration**: Install the [`dsh-better-deepseek`](https://github.com/EdgeTypE/dsh-better-deepseek) plugin in DeepSeek Harness for complete end-to-end integration.


### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Tool Access
Better DeepSeek supports the [Model Context Protocol](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io) for connecting to remote MCP servers. When configured, the AI can discover and invoke tools from these servers automatically.

- **Add a server**: Open Settings → MCP Servers, enter the server URL and optional API key.
- **Test the connection**: Click "Test" to verify the server responds and list its available tools.
- **How it works**: Tool schemas are injected into the system prompt. When the AI outputs `<BDS:AUTO:MCP url="..." tool="..." args='...'>`, the extension calls the tool and injects the result back into the conversation as an attached file.

The extension speaks HTTP/Streamable HTTP. The included local proxy makes stdio-only MCP servers usable through that HTTP interface.

### Roblox Vibe Coding

Better DeepSeek supports a complete Roblox Studio vibe-coding loop through MCP: inspect the live place, find scripts and instances, read existing code, make focused edits, execute Luau, run playtests, inspect console output, and verify the result. The assistant is instructed to use evidence from Studio instead of inventing paths or guessing tool arguments.

#### Roblox Studio MCP

This repository includes a Windows bridge for Roblox Studio's official local `StudioMCP.exe` server. It converts Roblox's newline-delimited stdio transport into an HTTP MCP endpoint for Better DeepSeek and repairs common AI-generated argument mistakes such as `path` vs. `target_file`.

1. Build or download the extension and load `dist-chrome` in Chrome using Developer mode.
2. Put `outputs/better-deepseek-mcp-connector.rbxm` into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Roblox\Plugins`.
3. Open Roblox Studio, open a place, and enable `Assistant Settings → MCP Servers → Enable Studio as MCP server`.
4. Double-click `start-roblox-mcp.bat` once. It is safe to click again; it detects an existing healthy proxy instead of creating a duplicate port listener.
5. In Better DeepSeek Settings → MCP Servers, add or use the `Roblox Studio` preset with this URL:
   `http://127.0.0.1:3197/mcp`
6. Click Test. The server should expose tools such as `execute_luau`, `script_read`, `script_search`, `multi_edit`, `get_studio_state`, and `search_game_tree`.

To start the bridge automatically after Windows login, run `install-roblox-mcp-startup.bat` once. The proxy waits for Roblox Studio to reconnect when Studio opens.

The connector package is a local Roblox Studio plugin and is credited to EdgeTypE's Better DeepSeek project. Roblox Studio MCP remains Roblox software and is subject to Roblox's terms and privacy requirements.

#### Desktop Vibe Coding MCP

The included `scripts/desktop-mcp-server.mjs` exposes a localhost-only Desktop MCP server for the approved workspace. It provides system information, directory listing, text-file reading/search, process listing, port checks, confirmed file writes, and confirmed launching of Roblox Studio, Chrome, Notepad, or Calculator.

Run it with `npm run mcp:desktop`, then add `http://127.0.0.1:3198/mcp` using the `Desktop Vibe Coding` preset. File access is restricted to the server's workspace root; writes and application launches require `confirm: true`. Use `start-better-deepseek-mcp.bat` to start Roblox and Desktop MCP together.

For Roblox Studio and other stdio-only desktop MCP servers, run the local bridge first and then add the HTTP proxy URL here:

```bash
npm run mcp:roblox-proxy
```

That proxy exposes Roblox Studio on `http://127.0.0.1:3197/mcp` by default. You can also use `node scripts/stdio-mcp-proxy.mjs --command <your stdio command...>` for other desktop apps.

### LONG_WORK Project Mode
When building multi-file projects, DeepSeek can use the `<BDS:LONG_WORK>` tag. All files created inside this block are collected, zipped, and presented as a single download after the block closes. During generation, the user sees only a "Working..." indicator, keeping the chat clean.

![long work image](extension/1.png)

### Persistent Memory and Skills
- **Memory**: Store key-value facts about the user. "Always" memories are included in every request; "called" memories appear only when their key is mentioned.
- **Skills**: Upload markdown files that define custom instructions or behaviors. Skills can be toggled on and off from the drawer.
- **Characters**: Create and manage roleplay personas. Only one character can be active at a time.

### Voice Support (STT & TTS)
Better DeepSeek now supports full voice interaction:
- **Voice-to-Text**: Dictate your prompts using the microphone button next to the chat input. Supports optional auto-submission for a hands-free experience.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Assistant responses can be automatically read aloud once generation is complete.
- **Language Selection**: Configure your preferred voice and recognition language directly from the extension settings.

### Native Navigation
The DeepSeek logo and "New Chat" button have been transformed into native links, allowing for standard browser interactions such as "Open in New Tab" via right-click or Ctrl/Cmd+Click.

### User Interface
A sleek drawer slides out from a floating button on the DeepSeek page. Inside you can:
- Edit the system prompt.
- Toggle auto-download behavior for files and LONG_WORK zips.
- Import, export, download, and manage skills.
- Import, export, and manage memory entries.
- Create, edit, download, and activate characters/personas.
- Define Claude-style Projects, define project-level instructions, and upload project files and attach them to chats.

![long work image](extension/4.png)



### Code Block Download Buttons
Every code block in DeepSeek responses gains a "Download" button, making it easy to save snippets with the correct file extension.

### Advanced File Upload
The extension adds a "+" button next to the chat input, offering:
- Upload a folder (concatenates all text files into a single workspace file).
- Import a GitHub repository (fetches and packages the repo as a text file, with optional GitHub token support for private repositories).
- Fetch a web page (converts the main content to markdown).

## Installation

### Recommended: Browser Stores
The easiest way to install Better DeepSeek is through the official stores:
- **[Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/better-deepseek/aabiopennjmopfippagcalmkdjlepdhh)**
- **[Microsoft Edge Add-ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/better-deepseek/goboedojlaeplneahnmnobmendoeblld)**
- **[Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/better-deepseek/)**

### Latest Development Build
If you want to try the very latest features before they reach the store, you can download the **[Latest Automated Build](https://github.com/warpusTOM/red-deepseek/releases/tag/latest)**. Download the ZIP for browsers, or the **signed APK** for Android. Load the browser extension via "Load unpacked" in Chrome.

### Manual Installation (Developer Mode)
If you prefer to build from source or contribute to development:

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 18 or later)
- npm

#### Build from Source
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/warpusTOM/red-deepseek.git
   cd better-deepseek
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Build the extension:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This will create a `dist-chrome` and `dist-firefox` folder with the unpacked extension.

4. Load the extension in your browser:

   1. **Chrome**:
      1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`.
      2. Enable "Developer mode" (top-right toggle).
      3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `dist-chrome` folder.

   2. **Firefox**:
      1. Open Firefox and go to `about:debugging`.
      2. Click "This Firefox".
      3. Click "Load Temporary Add-on".
      4. Select the `better-deepseek-firefox.zip` file.

      *Note: Firefox build is experimental.*

The extension should now appear in your extensions list and be active on `chat.deepseek.com`.

## Usage

Once installed, visit [chat.deepseek.com](https://chat.deepseek.com). You will see a "BDS" button in the top-right corner. Click it to open the settings drawer.

### Using Tool Tags
Simply ask DeepSeek to perform a task that would benefit from one of the tools. For example:
- "Create a Python script that calculates the Fibonacci sequence and run it."
- "Make an interactive pendulum simulation."
- "Generate a PowerPoint presentation about climate change."
- "Build a complete React to-do app as a downloadable project."

DeepSeek will use the appropriate tags automatically (guided by the injected system prompt).

### Managing Memory
When DeepSeek writes to memory using `<BDS:memory_write>`, the entries appear in the "Stored Memory" section of the drawer. You can also manually import/export memory as JSON.

### Uploading Folders and GitHub Repos
Click the "+" button next to the chat input to reveal the advanced upload menu. Choose "Upload Folder" to select a local directory; the extension will concatenate all text files into a single upload. On browsers without the File System Access API (Firefox), the folder picker falls back to the browser's native directory input so the flow still works. "GitHub Repo" fetches the repository as a ZIP and converts it to a gitingest-style text file for context.

For private repositories, add a classic GitHub personal access token with `repo` scope in Advanced Settings. The token is stored locally in the extension and is only sent to GitHub when you explicitly fetch a repository.

### Building and Watching
- `npm run build` – Production build.
- `npm run dev` – Development build with watch mode.

After making changes, rebuild the extension and reload it from `chrome://extensions` (click the refresh icon on the extension card).

### Building for Android

Better DeepSeek can run as a standalone Android app. It wraps
`chat.deepseek.com` in a WebView and injects the BDS enhancement layer.

#### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | How to install |
|------|---------|----------------|
| Node.js | ≥18 | `winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS` |
| Java JDK | 17 | `winget install EclipseAdoptium.Temurin.17.JDK` |
| Android SDK | API 34 | Install Android Studio, then SDK Manager → Android 14.0 (API 34), Build-Tools 34.0.0, Command-line Tools |
| Gradle | 8.7 (one-time) | Download the binary-only ZIP from https://gradle.org/releases, extract, and add `bin/` to your PATH |

#### Environment Variables

Set these in your system or user environment variables (Windows — use `setx` in
Command Prompt, not PowerShell):

```
JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-17.0.19.10-hotspot
ANDROID_HOME=C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk
```

Also add `%ANDROID_HOME%\platform-tools` to your `Path`.

> **PowerShell pitfall:** In PowerShell, use `$env:JAVA_HOME` and `&` to call
> executables. In Command Prompt, use `%JAVA_HOME%` and double‑quote paths with
> spaces: `"%JAVA_HOME%\bin\java" -version`.

#### Verify the toolchain

Open a **Command Prompt** (cmd.exe) and run:

```cmd
echo %JAVA_HOME%
"%JAVA_HOME%\bin\java" -version
echo %ANDROID_HOME%
dir %ANDROID_HOME%\platforms
dir %ANDROID_HOME%\build-tools
dir %ANDROID_HOME%\cmdline-tools
gradle --version
```

You should see OpenJDK 17, `android-34`, `34.0.0` in build‑tools, `latest` in
cmdline‑tools, and Gradle 8.7.

#### Create local.properties

In the `android/` directory, create a file named `local.properties`:

```
sdk.dir=C:\\Users\\YourName\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk
```

Use **double backslashes** — this is a Java properties file. This file is
gitignored and must never be committed.

#### Bootstrap the Gradle wrapper (one-time)

```cmd
cd android
gradle wrapper --gradle-version 8.7 --distribution-type bin
```

This creates `gradlew.bat` and the `gradle/wrapper/` folder. After this you can
build with `gradlew` — the system Gradle is no longer needed.

#### Build the JavaScript bundles

```cmd
npm run build:android
```

This runs Vite with `--target=android` and copies the output (content.js,
injected.js, sandbox.js, sandbox.html, content.css) into
`android/app/src/main/assets/bds/`.

#### Build the APK

```cmd
cd android
gradlew assembleDebug
```

The first build downloads Gradle and Android dependencies — expect a few minutes.
Subsequent builds are fast. The debug APK lands at:

```
android\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk
```

#### Install and run

```cmd
adb install android\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk
```

Requires a physical device with USB debugging enabled, or an Android emulator
(create one via Android Studio's Device Manager — API 34, x86_64, Google Play
system image recommended).

#### Common pitfalls

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `%JAVA_HOME%` prints literally in PowerShell | Use `$env:JAVA_HOME` in PowerShell, or switch to cmd.exe |
| `'C:\Program' is not recognized` | Wrap the path in double quotes: `"%JAVA_HOME%\bin\java"` |
| Winget Temurin install fails with exit code 1602 | Run the downloaded MSI directly from `%TEMP%\WinGet\...` |
| `sdkmanager` doesn't show license prompt | Run it again; the prompt sometimes scrolls past. Type `y` and Enter |
| `Unresolved reference: BuildConfig` | Add `buildFeatures { buildConfig = true }` to `android { }` in `app/build.gradle.kts` |
| `INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE` | Uninstall the existing app first: `adb uninstall com.betterdeepseek.app` |
| Play Protect blocks installation | Tap "Install anyway" — debug APKs are unsigned |
| BDS toggle doesn't appear after login | Wait a few seconds; injection happens after the page fully loads |

### Design Principles
- The content script uses Svelte 5 for reactive UI components.
- The injected script patches `window.fetch` and `XMLHttpRequest` to modify outgoing chat completion requests.
- All data (settings, skills, memories, characters) is stored locally using `chrome.storage.local`.
- The extension is designed to be non-intrusive: it only modifies the DOM by adding host containers next to messages and hiding original markdown when tool tags are present.

## Privacy

Better DeepSeek does not collect, transmit, or sell any personal data. All settings, memories, skills, and characters are stored locally on your device. If you configure a GitHub personal access token for private repository support, it is stored locally and only sent to GitHub when you explicitly fetch a repository. See the full [Privacy Policy](extension/PRIVACY.md) for details.
